# SystemJVM

A Java implementation of the well known Unpkg node based CDN project.

## Motivation

- provide a feature complete self hostable Java implementation of [unpkg](https://github.com/unpkg/unpkg.com)
- support for ES module workflow similar to [JSPM](https://jspm.io/)
- support the best parts of HTTP/2

## Timeline
- 01/08/19 - 100% unpkg compatible release
- 01/11/19 - the JVM is faster than the JSVM (for now, I'm looking at you WASM) so let's make this release AFAP
- xx/xx/xx - design of ES6 module workflow
